## 11.5 
*Residuals and predictions*: The folder `Pyth` contains outcome $y$ and predictors $x_1$, $x_2$ for 40 data points, with a further 20 points with the predictors but no observed outcome. Save the file to your working directory, then read it into R using `read.table()`.

### (a) 
Use R to fit a linear regression model predicting $y$ from $x_1$, $x_2$, using the first 40 data points in the file. Summarize the inferences and check the fit of your model.

```{r}
pyth <- read.table("/Users/billg/Desktop/MA 678 Data/Pyth.csv",header=TRUE)
RegPyth <- glm(y~x1+x2,data=pyth)
summary(RegPyth)
#This Model Fits Well.#
```

### (b) 
Display the estimated model graphically as in Figure 11.2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplotpyth <- ggplot(pyth)
ggplotpyth+aes(x=x1+x2,y)+geom_point()+xlab("x1,x2")+ylab("y")+geom_smooth(method="glm",se=T)
```

### (c) 
Make a residual plot for this model. Do the assumptions appear to be met?

```{r}
pythResidual <- resid(RegPyth)
plot(pythResidual)
abline(0,0)

#"The plot is not distributed normaly, so it does not appear to meet the assumptions"#
#Assumptions:Expectation=0,Variance=sigma^2,Covariance=0#
```


### (d) 
Make predictions for the remaining 20 data points in the file. How confident do you feel about these predictions?

```{r}
first40 <- head(pyth,40)
remain20 <- tail(pyth,20)
RegPredict <- glm(y~x1+x2,data=pyth)
predict_points <- predict(RegPredict,newdata=remain20)
predict_points
```


## 12.5 
*Logarithmic transformation and regression*: Consider the following regression:
$$\log(\text{weight})=-3.8+2.1 \log(\text{height})+\text{error,} $$
with errors that have standard deviation 0.25. Weights are in pounds and heights are in inches.

### (a) 
Fill in the blanks: Approximately 68% of the people will have weights within a factor of ______ and ______ of their predicted values from the regression.

#68 95 99.7 rule tells us that 68% of the population is within one standard deviation of the mean.#
#Therefore, Approximately 68% of the people will have weights within a factor of 1.3 and 0.25 of their predicted values from the regression.#
#exp(0.25)=1.284


### (b) 
Using pen and paper, sketch the regression line and scatterplot of log(weight) versus log(height) that make sense and are consistent with the fitted model. Be sure to label the axes of your graph.

#The function is log(weight)=-3.8+2.1*log(height)
```{r}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/billg/Desktop/MA 678 Data/Logarithmic Graph.jpeg")


```


## 12.6 
*Logarithmic transformations*: The folder `Pollution` contains mortality rates and various environmental factors from 60 US metropolitan areas. For this exercise we shall model mortality rate given nitric oxides, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons as inputs. this model is an extreme oversimplication, as it combines all sources of mortality and does not adjust for crucial factors such as age and smoking. We use it to illustrate log transformation in regression.  

### (a) 
Create a scatterplot of mortality rate versus level of nitric oxides. Do you think linear regression will fit these data well? Fit the regression and evaluate a residual plot from the regression.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(foreign)
pollution <- read.dta("http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/pollution/pollution.dta")
summary(pollution)
plot(pollution$nox,pollution$mort)
Regpollution <- lm(mort~nox,data=pollution)
abline(Regpollution)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(Regpollution)
"I think linear regression will not fit these data well. The residual plot is not random."
```

### (b) 
Find an appropriate reansformation that will result in data more appropriate for linear regression. Fit a regression to the transformed data and evaluate the new residual plot.

```{r}
Regpollution2 <- lm(log(pollution$mort)~log(pollution$nox),data=pollution)

ggplot(data=pollution, aes(x=log(nox), y=log(mort))) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y ~ x)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(Regpollution2)
"The new Residual Plot is so much better since the points are spreaded out."
exp(6.81)
```

### (c) 
Interpret the slope coefficient from the model you chose in (b)

#The average morality rate is 906.81
#For each 1% of change in nox, the morality rate changes 2%

### (d) 
Now fit a model predicting mortality rate using levels of nitric oxides, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons as inputs. Use appropriate transformation when helpful. Plot the fitted regression model and interpret the coefficients.

```{r}
Regpollution3 <- lm(log(pollution$mort)~log(pollution$nox)+
                      log(pollution$hc)+log(pollution$so2),data=pollution)
summary(Regpollution3)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(Regpollution3)

""

```

### (e) 
Cross validate: fit the model you chose above to the first half of the data and then predict for the second half. You used all the data to construct the model in (d), so this is not really cross validation, but it gives a sense of how the steps of cross validation can be implemented.

```{r}

firsthalf <- head(pollution,30)
secondhalf <- tail(pollution,30)
Regpollution4 <- lm(log(pollution$mort)~log(pollution$nox)+
                      log(pollution$hc)+log(pollution$so2),pollution)
predict_pollution <- predict(Regpollution4,newdata=secondhalf)
predict_pollution
```

## 12.7 
*Cross validation comparison of models with different transformations of outcomes*: when we compare models with transformed continuous outcomes, we must take into account how the nonlinear transformation warps the continuous outcomes. Follow the procedure used to compare models for the mesquite bushes example on page 202.

### (a) 
Compare models for earnings and for log(earnings) given height and sex as shown in page 84 and 192. Use `earnk` and `log(earnk)` as outcomes.

```{r}
library(rstanarm)
earnings <- read.csv("/Users/billg/Desktop/MA 678 Data/earnings.csv")
#Regearnings <-stan_glm(earn~height+male,data=earnings)
#loo_1 <- loo(Regearnings)
#earnk <- kfold(Regearnings,K=10)
#earnk
#Regearnings2 <-stan_glm(log(earn)~log(height)+log(male),data=earnings)
#loo_2 <- loo(Regearnings2)
#log(earnk) <- kfold(Regearnings2,K=10)


```

### (b) 
Compare models from other exercises in this chapter.

#The models are similar. Some are just simpler. Logarithmic transformations are great"

## 12.8 
*Log-log transformations*: Suppose that, for a certain population of animals, we can predict log weight from log height as follows:  

* An animal that is 50 centimeters tall is predicted to weigh 10 kg.

* Every increase of 1% in height corresponds to a predicted increase of 2% in weight.

* The weights of approximately 95% of the animals fall within a factor of 1.1 of predicted values.

### (a) 
Give the equation of the regression line and the residual standard deviation of the regression.


#The equation should be: log(weight)=2*log(height)+log(10)-2*long(50)+error -> log(weight)=-5.5+2*log(height)+error
#Since 95% of the animals fall within a factor of 1.1 of predicted values,error is between -0.095 and 0.095.Then the residual standard deviation would be 0.0486.


### (b) 
Suppose the standard deviation of log weights is 20% in this population. What, then, is the $R^{2}$ of the regression model described here?  

#R^2=1-(0.0486/0.2)=0.757


## 12.9 
*Linear and logarithmic transformations*: For a study of congressional elections, you would like a measure of the relative amount of money raised by each of the two major-party candidates in each district. Suppose that you know the amount of money raised by each candidate; label these dollar values $D_i$ and $R_i$. You would like to combine these into a single variable that can be included as an input variable into a model predicting vote share for the Democrats. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the following measures:  

### (a) 
The simple difference, $D_i - R_i$

#The advantage of this measure is that the difference is easy to get and it's centered at zero. But this measure will not mean the same when D_i and R_i become larger.

### (b) 
The ratio, $D_i / R_i$

#The ratio is not recommended because if the republics party raise way more money than Democrats, the measure will approach to zero. Answers will be various.

### (c) 
The difference on the logarithmic scale, $\log D_i - \log R_i$   

#This measure is similar to part (a), better than (a), since there is a less severe increase or decrease, and is not much affected by the outliers.


### (d) 
The relative proportion, $D_{i}/(D_{i}+R_{i})$. 

#This measure is better than part (b). The relative proportion is not much affected if the money raised by republics party is very large. 

## 12.11
*Elasticity*: An economist runs a regression examining the relations between the average price of cigarettes, $P$, and the quantity purchased, $Q$, across a large sample of counties in the United  States, assuming the functional form, $\log Q=\alpha+\beta \log P$. Suppose the estimate for $\beta$ is 0.3.  Interpret this coefficient. 

#With the logarithmic scale, for every 1% change in the average price of cigarettes, there is a 0.3% change is the total cigarette quality purchased.

## 12.13
*Building regression models*: Return to the teaching evaluations data from Exercise 10.6. Fit regression models predicting evaluations given many of the inputs in the dataset. Consider interactions, combinations of predictors, and transformations, as appropriate. Consider several  models, discuss in detail the final model that you choose, and also explain why you chose it rather than the others you had considered. 

```{r}
beauty <- read.csv("/Users/billg/Desktop/MA 678 Data/beauty.txt")
head(beauty)
reg10.6a <- lm(eval~beauty+female+age,data=beauty)
plot(reg10.6a)
secondhalfbeauty <- tail(beauty,40)
predict_eval <- predict(reg10.6a,newdata=secondhalfbeauty)
plot(beauty$beauty, beauty$eval)
plot(beauty$female,beauty$eval)
plot(beauty$age,beauty$eval)

reg10.6b <- lm(eval~beauty*age+female,data=beauty)
plot(reg10.6b)


#I would choose the linear model since it's mostly accurate with stable graph.
```


## 12.14
Prediction from a fitted regression: Consider one of the fitted models for mesquite leaves, for example `fit_4`, in Section 12.6. Suppose you wish to use this model to make inferences about the average mesquite yield in a new set of trees whose predictors are in data frame called  new_trees. Give R code to obtain an estimate and standard error for this population average. You do not need to make the prediction; just give the code. 

```{r}
#fit_4 <- stan_glm(formula = log(weight) ~ log(canopy_volume) + log(canopy_area) 
# + log(canopy_shape) + log(total_height) + log(density) + group, data=mesquite)
#Predict_new_trees <- predict(fit_4,newdata=new_trees)



```
